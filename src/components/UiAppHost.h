// Owns the FreeInkApp hosting protocol every FUI screen shares, list-shaped or
// not: the font-bound render target, the app, and the uiReady handshake that
// lets the loop task route touch snapshots against the interaction table the
// render task rebuilds. FreeInkApp keeps the last complete interaction table
// published while it builds the next one, so the gate closes only when the
// old table is semantically invalid (screen reset/explicit close), not around
// an ordinary repaint. The handshake lives here exactly once so no screen
// re-implements (and mis-orders) it.
//
// UiListActivity layers list navigation on top of this; screens that are not a
// single list (sliders, prompts, state machines) inherit or hold this directly
// and keep their own input/loop logic.
